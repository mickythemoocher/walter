<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Pardon me Ma'am but Sir Walter awaits you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Already? I wasn't expecting him until tomorrow.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> He seems full of himself as usual.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Oooh, perhaps he has brought me something exciting from his travels.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">I wish he had got lost on his travels.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh come on now Kate, don't be mean about him.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> I think he is a stuck up, pompous ass.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't think so at all, I think he is quite dishy.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">And he smells.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> That's not his fault, deodorant hasn't been invented yet.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> He could at least have a wash occasionally.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> He has been at sea for two years. He's bound to whiff a bit. Anyway, you had better show him in.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF">Alright then. (loudly) Oi! Walt, you can come in now. And bring that smelly mate of yours with you.<p>
( After a short pause) <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Ahh You Majesty, It is such a delight to cast my eyes upon you once again.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen </font color="#0000FF">(very quietly) You're right Kate, he does whiff a bit. (normal voice) Sir Walter it is good to see you again and that you have returned safely from you voyage.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> It was a hazardous trip Ma'am but with the grace of God we have arrived home safely. Towards the end of the journey we had little food, little water and little hope.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Little soap too I should imagine Walt<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen. </font color="#0000FF">(quietly) Shusss Kate.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Alas dear lady, we had not of that at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Oh what a surprise. I would have been mortified without soap. I simply have to have a bath every six weeks if I need it or not.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> And who is this gallant young man with you Walter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">This is my very good friend and companion Bert.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Pleased to meet you Bert.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Nice to meet you too Miss<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">(in a whisper) Idiot, it's Ma'am, Ma'am not Miss<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Begging your pardon Ma'am Ma'am<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> (in a whisper) Just one Ma'am not two.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">You said Ma'am Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh you fool, I was just trying to make it clear to you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Saying it twice didn't make it seem very clear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Please excuse Bert Ma'am, he has been at sea a long time.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Possibly not long enough.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">A thousand apologies Your Majesty<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">That is a very nice head you have, Bert<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Thank you very much Miss, err sorry, I mean Ma'am Ma'am. Oh no, sorry just one Ma'am. Thank you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Looks perfectly balanced on your shoulders at the moment, it would be a shame to dislodge it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> Ooooh I love watching a good beheading.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So, Walter have you brought me back some wondrous gifts from you long travels?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">I have indeed Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Excellent, that is very exciting. Before you show me though I must have William here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Your personal advisor Ma'am?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, mostly he advises me on who's head to chop off.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Not mine I hope.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Fingers crossed, eh Bert?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Yes mi...... er.... Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Kate would you ask William to join us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">I suppose so. (loudly) Oi William. Come in here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">It will be a pleasure to see him again Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">You know he doesn't like you Walter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> A lot of people don't like walter. In fact I am his only friend.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Shut up Bert. - I am quite aware Ma'am that he does not like me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> In fact Walter, he detests you ( a little laugh). He keeps saying I should chop your head off.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">That would be unfortunate.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Not for me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So really Walter it won't really be a pleasure to see him again will it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">I suppose not.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Ah, William please come and join us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> Delighted to You Majesty<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Walter has bought back some gifts for me and I wanted your opinion of them.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> Which I would be delighted to do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> So what have you got to show me? And William, don't look at Walters head like that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> I beg your pardon Ma'am. I was just wondering how heavy it is.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">No need for that right at the moment. Walter?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Bert, please take the first gift from the bag.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> This is my favourite one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Pass it carefully to me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Here we are mate.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> (loudly) Oh my goodness! What on Earth is that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> Not the reaction we were expecting was it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Shhhh Bert.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> I do believe that is the ugliest thing I have ever seen. What's it called<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> It is called Ma'am  -   A potato.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Is it? That's news to me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">I believe he just made that up.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> (quietly) I might buy a new hat for the beheading.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> It is ugly, dirty, full of sprouty bits and if I am not mistaken, covered in mud.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> Can't argue with that can we?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">William, why are you smiling?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">Sorry Ma'am, no reason, no reason.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So Walter. What are we supposed to do with that disgusting looking article.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Well Ma'am, err, Actually, errr. Well the thing is if your Majesty agrees, and I quite understand if she doesn't.....<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">We should eat it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> (very loudly) EAT IT!!<p>
(William and kate laugh softly)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, hmm eat it. That's correct.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Walter, have you lost your mind? Do you think any sane person in this green and pleasant land will ever in their wildest dreams want to eat -  that!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> It's very popular in Spain.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">So is the inquisition but we don't want it here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> It really is quite delicious Ma'am<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">With plenty of salt, maybe some pepper, a smidge of mustard perhaps. Need something else with it to give it a bit of flavour, some beef perhaps, with some gravy added. Doesn't taste too bad then.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Will you shut up Bert.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> It certainly seems like something that would never pass my lips.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> I'm not sure it will ever pass Walts either ( a little laugh)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Walter, I am not happy with that gift. I was expecting gold or a diamond, something like that. It would be fair to say that I find a potato a gross disappointment.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">I would say that is an understatement.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">I would say I need to sharpen my ax.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Shhh William, We haven't got to that stage yet.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">I regret your disappointment. I had all good intentions of finding something that would feed the nation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">You'd be lucky to feed pigs with that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So Walter, what else do you have? I hope you will not disappoint me again.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> I rather hope he does.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF">I can't wait to see what he has next.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">My next gift Ma'am comes from far, far, far away from a land they call the Americas. While I was there,
                                          a small corner of this land your majesty, I named after you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Oh Walter, that is so very sweet indeed of you. Thank you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> Crawler.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">Biding his time.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So there is now a land far, far away called Elizabeth?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Err, well no, not exactly Ma'am. I named it Virginia?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> (surprised) Virginia? But my name is Elizabeth.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Well, yessssss but you know, you are a …. Oh never mind, I'll change it when I go back.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> I really think you better had.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So what is this wondrous gift from the land that was very nearly named after me?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">The other gift please Bert.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Just a minute, it's right down the bottom of the sack.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Get it out gently, I don't want it to break it up<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Here you are then.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter.</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, I have it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> I am waiting Walter:<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Waiting Ma'am?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Yes Walter, I am waiting to see my gift.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Ahh – Your gift Ma'am?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Yes Walt she is waiting for the gift you promised.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> I do hope for your sake, and your heads, that it is a good one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Well, yes, yes of course..<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> So where is it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Hmm I think this might be the point where I leave.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">You stay right here. This was your idea as much as mine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> No it wasn't!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Yes it was.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Boys, boys, will you please stop arguing amongst yourselves and show me my gift.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">(clears throat) Hmm well the thing is you Majesty, this is your gift.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> This?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Yes Ma'am, this.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh dear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Why are you smiling William?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">No reason. It must be wind.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">I repeat myself. This?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes Ma'am, this.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Do you mean Bert? Is he my gift?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> No, no, no not me. I'm not a gift<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> This Ma'am. This that I am holding in my hand?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> In your hand?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Errrr, yes. In my hand.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> But Walter, in your hand you have a.... well you have a leaf!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Not even a pretty one, it's all brown and wrinkled.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Almost uglier than the potato.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">But your Majesty, this is indeed a rather special leaf.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> (sarcastically) Ohh I see. A special leaf.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Is it magic then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">It had better be.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Not magic as such.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> I am beginning to feel very uncomfortable<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> I think that is a wise thing to feel Bert.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">But it is not just an ordinary leaf it has special qualities<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> So tell me Walter, what is the name of this leaf that has such special qualities.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> It is called tobacco ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">And it comes from a land called Elizabeth? Oh no not Elizabeth, Virginia?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Yes Ma'am it does.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So pray tell me Walter, what do we do with this – tobacco.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">This better be good.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate: </font color="#0000FF">Very good.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"></font color="#0000FF"> Firstly it needs to be shredded into very small pieces.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> I see, very interesting. Then what happens to my wonderful present?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">The next step is we roll the shreds into a small piece of paper.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> How exciting, I can hardly wait.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert:</font color="#0000FF"> I could do with rolling one right now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">I have a feeling it won't be the only thing rolling.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> I get that feeling too, rather strongly.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> So now we have the tiny shreds rolled in paper. What next?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">This is the exciting bit.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Next we, well we err.. Next we burn it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> (sarcastically again) Oh what fun. I can hardly wait to try it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Then so you shall your Majesty.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> ( very loudly)  I was joking Walter!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh I see, sorry<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> You will be.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> Not a good sign. When she has to tell you she is joking.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">There is more Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">You mean more presents?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">No, I mean more about this one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Then do tell.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">Once it is burning – well, hmm, you put it in your mouth.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> ( whistle quietly knowing it is going bad for Walter)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> (laughs). I am sorry Walter. I misheard you. I thought you said that once it is burning you put it in your mouth.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> I,  err, Yes, I did say that Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">William, pray tell me what you think of these gifts that Walter has brought to me?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">In all honesty Ma'am. I believe they are an insult to you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> I was thinking the very same thing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">I didn't ask you Kate.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kate:</font color="#0000FF"> Ooops, sorry.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">So what do we do with people that insult the queen William?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William: </font color="#0000FF">Quite often Ma'am – we chop off their heads<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen: </font color="#0000FF">Yes indeed, quite often we chop of their heads. Did you hear that Walter.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter</font color="#0000FF">( Big gulp) Yes I did Ma'am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Tell me then, you say this leaf has special qualities. So once we have shredded it, rolled it in paper, set fire to it then put it in our mouths, what is the special quality?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bert: </font color="#0000FF">Oh dear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter: </font color="#0000FF">To put it bluntly Ma'am, not wanting to beat about the bush, Telling it like it is, being open and frank......<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Queen:</font color="#0000FF"> Get on with it man – what does it do?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Walter:</font color="#0000FF"> Errr... It makes us cough<p> (Quite a long pause)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">William:</font color="#0000FF"> I'll just go see if my ax has been sharpened....<p>
